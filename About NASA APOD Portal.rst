NASA API (APOD) PORTAL
======================

The objective of the NASA API (Application Programming Interface) site
is to make NASA data, especially imagery, eminently accessible to
application develop-ers. When a user sends a request with APOD as an
endpoint, the API responds to the user with the picture of the day from
the NASA image repository.
